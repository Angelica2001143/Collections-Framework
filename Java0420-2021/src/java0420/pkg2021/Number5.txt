The " for-each " loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array.
A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently write a 
loop that needs to be executed a specific number of times. A for loop is useful when 
you know how many times a task is to be repeated.


The pros of foreach is very convenient,and It makes the code more readable.
while the cons is cannot process two decision-making statements at once.
And for the pros of for loop is able to execute blocks of code over and over again. 
The advantage to a for loop is we know exactly how many times the loop will execute before the loop starts.
And the cons is you cannot skip any element as the concept of index is not there.


1- forEach keeps the variable's scope to the block
2- Lower chance of accidental errors with forEach
3- forEach is easier to read
4- You can break out of a for loop earlier
