The " for-each " loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array.
A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently write a 
loop that needs to be executed a specific number of times. A for loop is useful when 
you know how many times a task is to be repeated.


1- forEach keeps the variable's scope to the block
2- Lower chance of accidental errors with forEach
3- forEach is easier to read
4- You can break out of a for loop earlier
